# Project Euler - Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

*(This is Problem 2 on the Project Euler website.)*

## My Solution

This solution uses a recursive function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to the limit (four million). It checks if each generated number is even and adds it to a running total if so.

## Potential Optimization

Recursion can be less efficient than iteration for large Fibonacci numbers due to function call overhead. An iterative solution using a while loop might be faster.
