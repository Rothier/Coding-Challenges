# Project Euler - Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triplet

## Problem Description

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a² + b² = c²

For example, 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5².

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

## My Solution

This solution iterates through possible values of `a` and `b` to find the Pythagorean triplet that sums to 1000.
