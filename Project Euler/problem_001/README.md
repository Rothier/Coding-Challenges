# Project Euler - Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

## Problem Description

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## My Solution

This solution iterates through numbers from 3 to 999, checking for divisibility by 3 or 5 using the modulo operator (`%`). If a number is divisible, it's added to a running total.
